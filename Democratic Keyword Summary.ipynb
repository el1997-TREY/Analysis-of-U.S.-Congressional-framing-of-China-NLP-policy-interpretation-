    "Congressional statements on tariffs express broad concern that sweeping or rapidly shifting tariff policies—especially those targeting China—impose significant costs on American consumers, farmers, and manufacturers. Lawmakers repeatedly note that China’s retaliatory tariffs and supply-chain disruptions have harmed U.S. exporters and increased economic uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment is that tariffs should be narrowly targeted at unfair Chinese trade practices rather than used indiscriminately in ways that weaken U.S. competitiveness and inadvertently strengthen China’s global position."

They warn that when the United States retreats from global leadership, cuts foreign aid, weakens institutions like USAID, or creates internal chaos, Russia and China quickly move to fill the vacuum through disinformation, economic coercion, military buildup, cyber intrusions, and soft-power competition. Across the statements, there is a clear call for a whole-of-government strategy that both counters growing Russia–China cooperation (including in nuclear arms, propaganda, and regional influence) and reinforces U.S. alliances, values, and global credibility."
