Whereas Panamanians and Americans have invested significantly to secure the sovereignty, stability, and prosperity of Panama, including the construction, defense, ] and transfer of the Panama Canal, ensuring it remains a critical asset for global commerce; Whereas the construction of the Panama Canal by the United States required more than a decade of work (1904-1914), involved tens of thousands of workers, and cost approximately $375,000,000, equivalent to more than $10,000,000,000 in 2025, with thousands of workers losing their lives due to disease and hazardous conditions; Whereas the defense and operation of the Panama Canal during the 20th century further demonstrated the United States' commitment, at significant financial and human cost, to maintaining the vital global trade route; Whereas the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, signed at Washington September 7, 1977 (commonly referred to as the ``Neutrality Treaty''), prohibits actions that undermine the canal's neutrality or threaten United States security interests and grants the United States the right to act, unilaterally if necessary, to defend the canal's neutrality and ensure its operational security; Whereas the Neutrality Treaty obligates Panama and the United States to act against any threat to the neutrality or peaceful operation of the Panama Canal, including undue foreign control over its infrastructure or management; Whereas when President Carter ratified the Neutrality Treaty, President Carter accepted a legally binding condition to the Treaty, adopted by the United States Senate, establishing an independent right of the United States to intervene militarily, consistent with United States constitutional processes, to reopen or restore the operations of the Panama Canal, as the United States deems necessary, to ensure the canal remains open, neutral, secure, and accessible; Whereas the People's Republic of China, through state-owned enterprises and Chinese government-affiliated private entities, has expanded its influence with key infrastructure projects and ports around the world, including in Panama, raising concerns about undue leverage and potential threats to free and fair navigation and trade; Whereas the People's Republic of China Belt and Road Initiative fosters economic dependence and exerts outsized geopolitical influence through its investments; Whereas Panama joined the Belt and Road Initiative in December 2018; Whereas the involvement of Chinese government-affiliated enterprises in the construction, management, and maintenance of other critical infrastructure, such as a proposed fourth bridge spanning the Panama Canal, calls into question the ability of Panama and the United States to defend the canal's neutrality and ensure its operational security; Whereas two major ports in Panama, the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, are currently managed by Chinese-affiliated entities, such as Hutchison Ports, a Hong Kong-based operator with significant ties to China's economic and political ecosystem, threatening the sovereignty of Panama and the security of the Western Hemisphere; Whereas the involvement of officials from the People's Republic of China and entities that are subject to the National Security Law of the People's Republic of China and similar laws in Panamanian ports and infrastructure compromises international security and disrupts critical trade routes; Whereas the People's Republic of China's control over portions of the infrastructure of the Panama Canal poses a direct threat to the national security and strategic interests of the United States; Whereas allowing foreign exploitation of Panama's ports and infrastructure undermines the sacrifices made to secure Panama's independence and the shared values between Panama and the United States; and Whereas the United States and Panama have a long history of partnership and shared commitment to democratic governance, sovereignty, and the rule of law: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) expresses profound concern about the presence and influence of the People's Republic of China in Panamanian ports and infrastructure, particularly in facilities of strategic significance such as the ports of Balboa and Cristobal; (2) calls upon the Government of Panama to-- (A) reaffirm its commitment to the ``permanent neutrality'' of the Panama Canal as defined by the Neutrality Treaty by seeking management structures that ensure unbiased, equitable access for vessels of all nations; (B) review and terminate agreements allowing Chinese state- owned enterprises or China-based so-called private entities to manage strategic infrastructure, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal; (C) expel all officials from the People's Republic of China operating within Panamanian ports and other critical infrastructure projects; and (D) reaffirm its commitment to maintaining the sovereignty of Panama and protecting the security of the Western Hemisphere by seeking partnerships that align with democratic values and mutual respect; (3) urges the Government of the United States to-- (A) leverage provisions in the Neutrality Treaty, including Condition (1), to monitor and address threats to the neutrality of the Panama Canal, acting decisively to counter undue foreign influence; (B) provide technical, financial, and strategic support to Panama as it seeks to assert sovereignty over its critical infrastructure and reduce its dependence on entities affiliated with the People's Republic of China; (C) strengthen collaboration with Panama and other allies in the region to promote transparent and sustainable investments in infrastructure projects; (D) establish a framework to restore operational control of the Panama Canal to a collaborative partnership between the United States and Panama, which should honor the spirit of the Neutrality Treaty, respect Panama's sovereignty, and incorporate United States expertise and resources to benefit both nations; (E) offer significant United States investments to modernize Panama's canal infrastructure and provide alternatives to Chinese-funded projects; and (F) develop a joint United States-Panama task force to oversee canal security and operations, enhancing regional security and ensuring freedom of navigation; (4) encourages Panama and other regional and global allies to monitor and counter efforts by authoritarian regimes to exploit economic vulnerabilities to gain strategic leverage in the Western Hemisphere;

Whereas, in recent years, the PRC has linked Resolution 2758 with its ``One China Principle'' and has claimed that Resolution 2758 addresses the matter of sovereignty over Taiwan; Whereas the ``One China Principle'' is a policy held by the Chinese Communist Party that-- (1) the PRC is the sole sovereign nation using the name ``China''; and (2) Taiwan is an inalienable part of China; Whereas Resolution 2758 did not endorse and is not equivalent to the ``One China Principle'' and countries that supported Resolution 2758 do not necessarily accept the ``One China Principle'';

Whereas the PRC misleadingly claims that countries with a ``one China policy'' have accepted and abide by the PRC's ``One China Principle''; Whereas Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said, in a 2024 hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, that Resolution 2758 ``is a tool to make the argument that somehow Taiwan's status is illegitimate'', and reiterated United States commitments to Taiwan; Whereas the ``one China policy'' of the United States acknowledges the PRC's ``One China Principle'', but affirms that-- (1) the United States does not take a position on Taiwan's status; and (2) this issue should be resolved peacefully by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait; Whereas, in 1982, during the administration of President Ronald Reagan, the United States conveyed Six Assurances to Taiwan's President Chiang Ching-kuo, including that the United States had not changed its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan, and each subsequent United States presidential administration has reaffirmed these Six Assurances; Whereas Taiwan has established representative offices in more than 60 countries and at the European Union and the World Trade Organization, which disproves the PRC's claim of a unified United Nations position or international consensus on Taiwan's status; Whereas the PRC has weaponized Resolution 2758 and the ``One China Principle'' to isolate Taiwan and to prevent its meaningful participation at the United Nations, United Nations-affiliated agencies, and other international fora, including at the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and Interpol; Whereas the PRC has bolstered its claims and engaged in revisionist history by successfully altering historic United Nations documents to changes references to ``Taiwan'' to ``Taiwan, Province of China''; Whereas, in 2005, the Secretary of the World Health Organization signed a memorandum of understanding with the PRC Ministry of Health regarding how the World Health Organization would engage with Taiwan, which included a requirement that communication with Taiwan go through the PRC; Whereas United Nations General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon cited Resolution 2758 when refusing Taiwan's accession to the United Nations in 2007, based on the incorrect assertion that Resolution 2758 supports China's claim that Taiwan is part of China; Whereas the United Nations has used Resolution 2758 as a justification for requiring Taiwan citizens, including those with official invitations to attend United Nations events, journalists, and representatives of nongovernmental organizations, to obtain PRC-issued Taiwan Compatriot Permits in addition to their passport or a PRC passport to gain entry to United Nations facilities; Whereas Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a statement in 2021, which criticized the United Nations' exclusion of Taiwan civil society members and emphasized that denying entry to such individuals undermines the work of the United Nations; Whereas, in 2022, Robert O'Brien, former United States National Security Advisor, stated that-- (1) the PRC manipulates Resolution 2758 to make false claims regarding Taiwan's status in order ``to undermine the international order and the international system''; and (2) Resolution 2758 ``relates solely to the occupancy of the China seat at the United Nations and nothing more''; Whereas, after the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China passed a model resolution clarifying the contents of Resolution 2758 in 2024, the Australian Senate, the Dutch House of Representatives, the United Kingdom House of Commons, the Canadian House of Commons, and the European Parliament have all approved resolutions opposing the PRC's distortion of Resolution 2758 and efforts by the PRC to block Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations; Whereas, in August 2023, the Central American Parliament (also known as ``PARLACEN'') expelled Taiwan, after more than 20 years as a permanent observer, from holding such status at its sessions and falsely claimed that Resolution 2758 deemed Taiwan a ``province of mainland China, which disqualifies it from participating as an Independent country''; Whereas, in October 2024, South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation echoed PRC propaganda by inaccurately citing Resolution 2758 as justification to direct Taiwan's representative office to relocate outside of the capital, Pretoria; Whereas the PRC cites Resolution 2758 as a justification to coerce, intimidate, or punish sovereign nations for engagement and partnership with Taiwan; and Whereas, since 2016, the PRC has successfully induced or pressured 10 nations: Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Burkina Faso, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Nauru, to cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) reaffirms that the longstanding ``one China policy'' of the United States does not affirmatively recognize the People's Republic of China's claim to control over Taiwan and its outlying islands, but rather ``acknowledges'' this position, reaffirms the interest of the United States in a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues, ``has not agreed to take any position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan'', and ``will not exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC''; (2) reaffirms that the ``one China policy'' of the United States and the similar policies of its partners are not equivalent to the ``One China Principle'' of the Chinese Communist Party; (3) emphasizes that United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 is not equivalent to, and does not endorse, the PRC's ``One China Principle''; (4) emphasizes further that Resolution 2758 does not take a position on Taiwan's ultimate political status, as explicitly recognized by PRC leaders at the time, and does not represent a United Nations consensus on Taiwan's status; (5) opposes China's use of the ``One China Principle'' to coerce the United States, Taiwan, and other countries to accept its claims over Taiwan; (6) supports Taiwan's diplomatic allies in continuing official relationships with Taiwan, and other nations across the world in strengthening their partnerships with Taiwan; ] (7) reaffirms support for Taiwan's membership in international organizations for which statehood is not a requirement for membership and encourages meaningful participation for Taiwan in organizations in which its membership is not possible; (8) recognizes that Taiwan is a reliable and indispensable partner on issues ranging from global health to advanced manufacturing, and its resources and expertise are assets from which the international community should fully benefit; (9) supports ensuring that Taiwan passport holders are able to access United Nations grounds and should not be required to provide PRC-issued identification; (10) encourages the United States Government to work with partners on joint efforts to counter China's false narratives about Resolution 2758; and (11) supports the efforts of other countries to differentiate between their policies and the ``One China Principle'' to counter China's propaganda about international views of Taiwan.""]",None,

Whereas, in March 2024, the Hong Kong government enacted national security legislation to implement Article 23 of the Basic Law, officially called the ``Safeguarding National Security Ordinance'' and also referred to as the ``Article 23 Ordinance'', which expanded the number of broadly defined national security criminal offenses to include, among other things, ``external interference'' and ``sabotage'', weakened legal protections for suspects accused of national security offenses, authorized new punitive measures targeting Hong Kong citizens and non-citizens overseas, and created risks for Hong Kong residents who interact with foreigners; Whereas nearly 300 people have been arrested under the Hong Kong national security law and the Article 23 Ordinance; Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China uses the Hong Kong national security law and the Article 23 Ordinance to harass, target, and threaten non-Hong Kong citizens and those outside of Hong Kong, and has become a significant perpetrator of transnational repression, including by posting cash bounties for democracy activists living in self-exile outside of Hong Kong; Whereas, on November 19, 2024, the Hong Kong government sentenced a group of pro-democracy activists, journalists, and former lawmakers commonly known as the ``Hong Kong 47'' to jail terms ranging between 4 and 10 years as a demonstration of the Hong Kong government's willingness to intimidate and persecute its political opponents; Whereas, Mr."", 'Jimmy Lai, a 77-year-old Hong Kong pro- democracy advocate and media entrepreneur, has been targeted and persecuted for decades, most recently through multiple prosecutions, including related to exercising his rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, his sentencing to over five years in prison under politically motivated fraud charges and the seizure of his multimillion dollar independent media organization Apple Daily by the Hong Kong authorities; Whereas, Mr.', ""Lai that may have been obtained through torture, Hong Kong authorities' interference with the independence of the judiciary throughout the case, and harassment and intimidation of Mr."", ""Lai's lawyers, undermining his right to a defense; Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China's undermining of democracy in Hong Kong has ramifications for the international order, including with regard to the future of Taiwan; Whereas the Hong Kong government has conducted a public relations campaign to convince global business leaders that Hong Kong remains a critical and attractive international financial center, while simultaneously undermining the independence of institutions that encouraged its growth over the past several decades; Whereas Hong Kong has increasingly become a hub for the transshipment of export-controlled goods and sanctions evasion relating to the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, directly supporting Russia's defense industrial base and enabling its continuing war of aggression against Ukraine; Whereas Hong Kong still maintains a separate voting share from the People's Republic of China at many multilateral organizations--including the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Financial Action Task Force, the International Olympic Committee, and the World Trade Organization--effectively doubling the People's Republic of China's voting power at these critical institutions; and Whereas the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (Public Law 116-76; 22 U.S.C."", ""5701 note), signed into law in November 2019, requires the President to impose sanctions ] to promote accountability for those responsible for certain conduct that undermines fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) condemns the Government of the People's Republic of China's ``Hong Kong national security law'', the Hong Kong government's ``Safeguarding National Security Ordinance'', and related abuses of internationally recognized human rights; (2) urges all governments that value democracy or autonomy to hold the Chinese Communist Party and the Hong Kong authorities accountable for their destruction of Hong Kong's autonomy, rule of law, and freedoms; (3) supports the people of Hong Kong as they fight to exercise fundamental rights and freedoms, as enumerated by-- (A) the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong, done at Beijing December 19, 1984; (B) the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966; and (C) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, done at Paris December 10, 1948; (4) condemns the Government of the People's Republic of China's practice of bringing false and politically motivated charges against Hong Kongers and the expansion of Hong Kong's national security regime that destroys the rule of law and undermines citizens' rights in Hong Kong; (5) calls upon the Hong Kong government to immediately drop all sedition, national security law, and Article 23- related charges and free all defendants immediately, including Jimmy Lai; (6) expresses extreme concern about the Government of the People's Republic of China' state-directed theft of Apple Daily, and holds that Hong Kong no longer has credibility as an international business center due to the erosion of the regulatory, legal, and judicial environments that have promoted its economic growth for decades; (7) encourages the United States Government and other governments to take steps at multilateral institutions to ensure that voting procedures recognize that there is no longer a meaningful distinction between Hong Kong and mainland China; and (8) urges the United States Government to use all available and appropriate tools, including those authorized by the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, in response to the Government of the People's Republic of China's actions in Hong Kong.""]",None,

'In fact, China has already responded.', 'They have also taken other measures to make it harder for the American businesses that produce goods here to export those to China.', 'When China puts on a 34-percent tariff and when other countries around the world respond as they inevitably will, it means American companies here at home will not be able to sell as many of their goods around the world.', ""If anybody doubts this does not cost American producers and manufacturers, let's just look back to the first Trump administration, where there was a mini version of this tariff war, a much smaller one, and even that smaller one cost the American taxpayers dearly because what happened was, when President Trump in his first term imposed tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States, China responded."", 'Again, it is simple math that those American producers sold fewer goods in China, and it cost them.', 'While most of our products are manufactured in the UK and the European Union, 20 to 25 percent of our product, which is designed in the UK, is manufactured in China.', 'Today is getting even worse because, quite naturally, other countries, including China-- and I have no love for China and its policies--well, they put on a retaliatory tariff.', ""Today's actions by China make a recession even more likely, and the American people suffer all because he wants to give tax breaks to the billionaires."", 'He is imposing these tariffs, raising the costs on American families, an average of about $5,000--the number is probably going to go up after what China did today--all to give tax breaks to billionaires.', 'And what we are now seeing this morning is that China is imposing reciprocal tariffs.', 'Economists who studied the tariffs that Trump imposed during the first term on certain goods from China found it was consumers--it was consumers--it was you that paid the price.', 'China just imposed a 34-percent reciprocal tariff for our 54-percent tariff on Chinese goods.', 'Earlier this week, for the first time in years, China and Japan and South Korea discussed the possibility of working together on free trade as a response to Donald John Trump.', 'Just to see them shaking hands is a big deal, but to see them shaking hands--literally holding hands--with a high official from China to indicate they are in this together against us.', 'We have been working very carefully to deepen the relationship they have with each other and with us to check against the nation that we all in this Chamber and President Trump also view as our chief adversary: China.', 'They met with China to talk about a free- trade agreement.', 'They met with China to talk about how they need to band together to protect themselves from the economic policy of the United States.', ""Donald Trump's tariffs are chasing Japan and South Korea into China's arms--idiocy."", 'We have trade surpluses with Brazil, Australia, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the UK.', ""In Donald Trump's first term, he encouraged American businesses to move their supply chains out of China, and a lot of businesses did."", ""Many American businesses followed Donald Trump's instructions and moved their supply chains from China to Vietnam."", 'He told these American companies: Pull your supply chain out of China.', 'Well, that is quite a way to treat American companies that moved their supply chains out of China at your request just a few years ago.', 'Certainly, they can be used to combat unfair trading practices used by adversaries like China, and I support those types of tariffs.', 'For example, last year, I supported the 100-percent tariff we imposed on Chinese electric vehicles.', 'We know the Chinese Government is actively working to undermine our national security and our economic success.', ""And companies backed by the Chinese Communist Party are flooding the global marketplace with artificially cheap vehicles that are, really, actually capable of stealing Americans' personal data, committing espionage, and even manipulating folks on the road while they are driving."", 'If President Trump is serious--if he is serious, big question, if he is serious--about leveling the playing field and bringing auto manufacturing jobs back to the United States, here is a playbook that he could actually follow: One, we need to pursue targeted tariffs on our adversaries, like China and our biggest overseas competitors, to ensure that more cars that are sold in America are built here in America.', ""China, unfortunately, has found ways to take advantage of the agreement's preferred treatment of goods by locating facilities in Mexico."", 'We need to double down on our efforts to deter trade cheats like China, which requires providing more resources for our Federal trade Agencies, not indiscriminately firing Federal workers.', 'Ten percent on all goods from all countries, 20 percent on goods from the European Union, 24 percent on goods from Japan, and 34 percent on goods from China.', 'We would understand the intentions and goals of our adversaries--the Chinese, the Russians, the North Koreans, the Iranians--by getting that superclassified information, that top secret information that only intelligence communities can pick up and then turning that into a plan to protect the country and then, in some cases, go offensive, right?', 'Now that we have stepped away from our leadership role around the world, we are seeing those who do not share our values--China and Russia.', 'Make no mistake, China and Russia are there to fill the gaps.', 'How is America made safer by firing the people responsible for responding to cyber attacks like Salt Typhoon or the Chinese that have literally infiltrated all of our telecom networks?', 'From a counterintelligence perspective, this was the effective equivalent of shouting our national security secrets on the busy streets of Beijing or leaving folders of information in cafes near the Kremlin.', ""This outrageous decision resulted in losses for Ukraine on the frontline and emboldened Putin and other dictators around the world, like China's Xi Jinping, undermining Ukraine's bargaining position and ours and American national security."", ""China and Russia and others are surely monitoring these officials' unclassified phones, and Signal is not immune."", ""No wonder why Xi Jinping thinks that the United States is in decline, ] that there are great changes unseen in the country, as he put it, and that he can simply wait for President Trump to accelerate our decline by tearing down the bedrock of America's national security and our prosperity."", 'No wonder why Xi continues to ramp up pressure on Taiwan, with live- fire exercises around the island earlier this week, and Putin continues to wage his unjustified war on Ukraine while threatening NATO allies like Poland and the Baltics.', 'He would maintain a vast ownership of the stock in it, but anyone in the world could buy in, from a Chinese national under indictment in the United States to any Sultan in the Middle East looking to buy influence.', 'I understand that the current President of the United States thinks that it is a hoax originating in China, but that is not what 99.5 percent of the scientists who have studied the issue believe.', 'It would rescind any tariffs put in place after January 20 that have increased the cost of groceries, medicines, and everyday goods, and it would leave in place tariffs on adversaries like China, Russia, and North Korea.']",Schumer,D

Whereas the United States is a founding member of the Arctic Council and has twice served as Chair, from 1998 to 2000, and again from 2015 to 2017; Whereas the Ottawa Declaration defines 8 states, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United States, as Arctic states and members of the Arctic Council as they have sovereignty over territory in the Arctic region; Whereas the Arctic region is undergoing unprecedented environmental, economic, and social changes due to the impacts of climate change and increased human activity; Whereas the Arctic Council has an advanced understanding of Arctic challenges through scientific assessments, policy recommendations, and collaborative initiatives;

Whereas the United States has supported collaborative Arctic Council initiatives such as the Circumpolar Wildland Fire Initiative, developed under Norway's Chairship, in partnership with Gwich'in Council International;

Whereas, in 2023, there were an estimated 263,000,000 cases of malaria in 83 countries and 597,000 malaria-related deaths worldwide, with 94 percent of those cases in Africa; Whereas 2 decades of global progress in reducing malaria cases and deaths has stalled in recent years; Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to, and disproportionately affected by, malaria, with children younger than 5 years of age accounting for 74 percent of malaria deaths each year; Whereas, since 2000, global investments in malaria intervention programs prevented an estimated 2,200,000,000 malaria cases and 12,700,000 malaria-related deaths; Whereas the United States played a leading role in more than 2 decades of progress toward reducing the global burden of malaria, particularly through the President's Malaria Initiative and contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria;

(2) India, with 69 percent fewer cases since 2017; and (3) Liberia, with 44 percent fewer cases since 2017; Whereas, as of 2025, there is a suite of new and evolving tools that show great promise in fighting malaria, including next-generation bed nets, diagnostics and treatment, malaria vaccines for young children, spatial repellants, and gene drive technologies; Whereas recent progress against malaria has stalled due to biological threats, such as insecticide and drug resistance, human factors such as conflict and displacement, and other political and resource factors, which threaten a significant increase in cases; Whereas there is an average of 2,000 imported cases per year in the United States due to United States citizens who travel, work, and are deployed overseas; Whereas fighting malaria makes the United States safer by-- (1) decreasing the risk of illness and death for United States citizens who travel, work, and are deployed to endemic regions; (2) preventing a resurgence of malaria in the United States, the risk of which was illustrated by the local transmission of malaria in Florida, Texas, and Maryland in 2023; and (3) protecting United States servicemembers and their families abroad, who frequently deploy to regions where malaria is endemic; Whereas fighting malaria makes the United States stronger by-- (1) enhancing global stability by addressing a root cause of destabilization, unrest, and terrorism that threatens United States interests and security; (2) countering the influence of the People's Republic of China in strategic regions targeted by the Belt and Road Initiative; and (3) bolstering United States global leadership, strengthening alliances, and creating diplomatic leverage; and Whereas fighting malaria makes the United States more prosperous by-- (1) driving United States-led innovation, including recent scientific breakthroughs that benefit the United States; (2) supporting universities, military-based research institutions, faith-based organizations, and private-sector companies in the United States that have been intrinsically involved, committed, and invested in the fight against malaria; (3) expanding markets for United States goods and services, with 1 recent estimate finding that United States exports would grow by $1,480,000,000 if global malaria reduction targets are achieved by 2030; (4) protecting United States taxpayers by preventing rather than responding to outbreaks of malaria, as the median cost of protecting 1 person from malaria ranges from $0.53 to $5.97, while treatment for each case of severe malaria costs approximately $145.23; and (5) supporting United States businesses by creating stable markets that are more favorable for United States investment: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day; (2) finds that it is in the national interest of the United States to fight malaria; (3) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria prevalence and deaths to improve maternal and child health; (4) commends progress made toward reducing global malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevalence, particularly through the efforts of the President's Malaria Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; (5) supports efforts to reduce malaria case incidence and mortality rates by not less than 90 percent by 2030; (6) commends the efforts and achievements of endemic countries in preventing and treating malaria and supports efforts to increase local ownership over malaria programs with the goal of ultimately graduating from aid to self- sufficiency; (7) welcomes public-private partnerships to research and develop more effective and affordable tools for malaria prevention, diagnosis, and treatment; and (8) supports and encourages continued leadership by the United States in reducing the global burden of malaria through bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts, including through the President's Malaria Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.""]",None,

Communist Party poses to our homeland are not only real, but they are right here.', ""In the Homeland Security Committee and on my Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, we have heard from a wide array of national security experts and law enforcement officials who have continuously raised alarms about the CCP's increasing subversive activities inside our country through organizations like the CCP's Confucius Institutes, the Thousand Talents Program, and other CCP- affiliated groups."", 'While Confucius Institutes are presented as centers for promoting Chinese language and culture, it is proven that they have been used to steal critical research, recruit talent for military-civil fusion enterprises, conduct espionage, commit transnational repression, and influence academic institutions to the benefit of the CCP.', 'Many of these programs have rebranded themselves within universities with the same mission as before, and that is to subvert national security and expand CCP influence operations.', ""] Another example is the CCP's Thousand Talents Program, which the FBI has listed as the most prolific sponsor of State-sponsored talent recruitment programs that bring outside knowledge and innovation back to China, often through stealing trade secrets, breaking export control laws, or violating conflict of interest policies."", 'These talent recruitment programs are a win-win for China.', 'China wins twice.', 'taxpayers are funding their research, not China; and, second, China then uses the research it would not have otherwise had to advance its own economic and military interests.', '881, my legislation which, by the way, is bipartisan, that would prohibit DHS from funding American universities that host a Confucius Institute or Thousand Talents Program or maintain relationships with Chinese entities of concern.', 'The DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act would play a vital role in protecting our students, intellectual property, and national security.', 'Together, this effort demonstrates a unified, bipartisan way to protect our Nation from the insidious influence of the CCP, and that our students, our

rewrite the story of the Chinese Communist Party one classroom at a time.', 'This is part of a broader effort by Beijing to manipulate the next generation, whether through TikTok on their phones or

Chinese Communist Party, I can ] tell you the threat is real, and the evidence is overwhelming.', 'It is not for sale to Beijing and not on our watch.', 'This bill would block Department of Homeland Security funding from colleges and universities with a Confucius Institute, which is known to have CCP ties, but it expands the prohibition to any institution that has a relationship with a Chinese entity of concern.', 'What is a Chinese entity of concern?', 'Because a bill defines such entities so broadly, that list could potentially include every single college in China.', 'Because this is a new definition that is not shared with any other Federal agency, universities would be required to independently verify that their Chinese counterpart institutions do not meet this broad definition just to cooperate on activities as simple as study abroad programs.', 'This is a completely unreasonable expectation of universities, and that is because the real goal of the legislation is to completely sever academic relations with institutions in China.', 'Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on the DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act.', 'Speaker, over the past decade, Communist China has persecuted the Uyghur population for their religious and cultural practices.', 'Xinjiang authorities have detained Uyghurs in internment camps without formal charges, forced them into slave labor, and have committed numerous other human rights abuses against the Uyghur people.', ""While the Chinese Communist Party refuses to admit it, researchers believe these abuses are a part of China's ``second-generation ethnic policy.''

Whereas the leader of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong, assured the Dalai Lama that ``the Tibetan people have the right of exercising national regional autonomy'' under Chinese rule and conveyed to the Dalai Lama that Tibet's distinct religious and cultural traditions would be respected, as reflected in the Seventeen Point Agreement of 1951; Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China, led by the Chinese Communist Party, steadily eroded the Tibetan autonomy to which it committed in the Seventeen Point Agreement through repressive political and military actions, leading to tension, resistance, and ultimately the Dalai Lama's exile in 1959; Whereas, in March 1959, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet after Chinese Communist forces began shelling Lhasa and has since been residing in India, along with tens of thousands of Tibetan refugees; Whereas, for more than 7 decades, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has significantly advanced greater understanding, tolerance, harmony, and respect among the religious faiths of the world; Whereas the Dalai Lama has led the effort to preserve the rich and distinct cultural, religious, historical, and linguistic heritage of the people of Tibet while working to safeguard other endangered cultures throughout the world; Whereas the Dalai Lama has been gravely concerned by the degraded state of the environment of Tibet and the unchecked exploitation of the natural resources of Tibet, including fresh water, because they have implications not only for Tibetans, but also for the whole of Asia; Whereas, beginning in 1979, the Dalai Lama has visited various parts of the United States and subsequently gained the admiration of all levels of society in the United States; Whereas the people of the United States have consistently expressed their appreciation for the culture and religion of Tibetan Buddhists, including through their support of its preservation, and political and diplomatic support for the Dalai Lama in his capacity as a spiritual leader; Whereas there is strong bipartisan support from successive Congresses and Administrations for the Dalai Lama's vision for Tibet and the world and for a negotiated resolution that leads to meaningful autonomy for Tibetans that ensures they are able to freely practice their religion, culture, and language;

Whereas, in 2011, the 14th Dalai Lama declared that the responsibility for identifying a future 15th Dalai Lama will ``primarily rest'' with officials of Gaden Phodrang, the Dalai Lama's office, and that ``apart from the reincarnation recognized through such legitimate methods, no recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for political ends by anyone, including those in the People's Republic of China''; Whereas, in 2011, the 14th Dalai Lama initiated a historic devolution of power to the Central Tibetan Administration, in which he formally renounced his political role, transferring full democratic governance to an elected Tibetan leadership, thereby ensuring a democratic and secular political system for Tibet; Whereas, on December 21, 2020, the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 (subtitle E of title III of division K of Public Law 116-260; 134 Stat."", ""6901 note), including by-- (1) addressing the issue of water security and environmental destruction in Tibet;

(4) stating that it is the policy of the United States that ``decisions regarding the selection, education, and veneration of Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders are exclusively spiritual matters that should be made by the appropriate religious authorities within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and in the context of the will of practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism'' and that the wishes of the 14th Dalai Lama ``should play a key role'' in the selection, education, and veneration of a future 15th Dalai Lama; and (5) stating that it is the policy of the United States to hold accountable, including through the imposition of sanctions, any officials of the People's Republic of China or the Chinese Communist Party who directly interfere with the identification and installation of a future Dalai Lama; Whereas, on July 12, 2024, the Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act (Public Law 118-70; 138 Stat."", ""1488) was signed into law, with the Act affirming that it is the policy of the United States that the Tibet issue must be resolved in accordance with international law by peaceful means, through dialogue without preconditions, and that the People's Republic of China should cease propagating disinformation about Tibet's history, and stating that it is the sense of Congress that the People's Republic of China's claims that Tibet has been part of the People's Republic of China since ``ancient times'' are ``historically inaccurate''; Whereas the Central Tibetan Administration, the institution that represents and reflects to the greatest extent the aspirations of the Tibetan diaspora around the world, has officially decided to celebrate the 14th Dalai Lama's 90th birth year as the ``Year of Compassion'';

(2) congratulates His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama on his 90th birthday and affirms its recognition of his outstanding contributions to peace, nonviolence, human rights, and mutual respect within and across faiths; (3) affirms the Tibetan people's internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including their right to exercise regional autonomy and to protect the distinct religious, cultural, linguistic, and historical identity of the Tibetan people; (4) reiterates, as outlined in the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 (subtitle E of title III of division K of Public Law 116-260), that the identification and installation of Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders, including a future 15th Dalai Lama, is a matter that should be determined by the present 14th Dalai Lama and within the Tibetan Buddhist faith community, in accordance with the inalienable right to religious freedom; (5) reiterates that any attempt by the Government of the People's Republic of China or any other government to recognize a successor or reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama and any future Dalai Lamas not selected by the Tibetan people would represent a clear abuse of the right to religious freedom of Tibetan Buddhists and the Tibetan people;

Whereas, according to numerous scientific studies and models, a large-scale nuclear war would kill hundreds of millions of people directly and cause unimaginable physical destruction and environmental damage, including even more severe catastrophic climate disruption due to lower temperatures across the planet not seen since the last ice age; Whereas, during the course of the nuclear age, there have been technical miscalculations, misinterpretations of adversary behavior, and crises that have caused numerous nuclear near-misses that could have led to nuclear war; Whereas the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and the repeated explicit threats of the Kremlin to use nuclear weapons have significantly increased the risk of nuclear weapons use; Whereas tensions elsewhere in the world, including between the United States and the People's Republic of China over Taiwan and the South China Sea, ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, and the chronic security crisis on the Korean Peninsula, constitute other possible flashpoints for nuclear war; Whereas, on October 6, 2022, President Biden said, ``I don't think there's any such thing as an ability to easily a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.''; Whereas the United States retains a Cold War-era nuclear declaratory policy that allows for the first use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear threats under ``extreme'' circumstances and retains a launch-under-attack posture that unnecessarily compresses Presidential decision time to launch nuclear weapons within minutes, thereby creating conditions that increase the risk of unintentional or accidental nuclear war; Whereas, in 2023, the Congressional Budget Office (referred to in this preamble as the ``CBO'') estimated that current plans to modernize, upgrade, and maintain the nuclear forces of the United States, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget and supporting documents, would cost $756,000,000,000 over the 2023-2032 period, which was $122,000,000,000 more than the 2021 CBO estimate for the 2021-2030 period; Whereas, in October 2017, CBO estimated that implementing the Nuclear Modernization Plan, which intends to upgrade and enhance nearly every element of the nuclear arsenal of the United States, would result in costs of more than $1,200,000,000,000 over the following 30 years, not adjusting for inflation; Whereas Republican and Democratic administrations have negotiated multiple agreements with the Russian Federation that have reduced their total nuclear stockpiles by more than 80 percent since their Cold War peaks, but in recent years have withdrawn from other global treaties and agreements that have provided global stability and helped prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, including the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate- Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, signed at Washington December 8, 1987 (commonly known as the ``Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty''); Whereas the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review states that ``utual, verifiable nuclear arms control offers the most effective, durable and responsible path to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our strategy and prevent their use''; Whereas the Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed at Prague April 8, 2010 (TIAS 11-205), which is the last remaining treaty limiting the size of the strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation, will expire on February 5, 2026, and in the absence of agreed following constraints, each side could significantly increase the number of deployed warheads, thereby accelerating an unconstrained, costly, and dangerous global nuclear arms race; Whereas, on July 7, 2017, 122 nations voted to adopt the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which prohibits the possession, use, testing, stationing, or transfer of nuclear weapons and creates an important legal framework for the elimination of all nuclear weapons and entered into force on January 22, 2021;

and (2) lead a global effort to halt and reverse a global nuclear arms race and prevent nuclear war by-- (A) engaging in good faith negotiations with-- (i) the other 8 nuclear armed countries to-- (I) halt any further buildup of nuclear arsenals; and (II) aggressively pursue a verifiable and irreversible agreement or agreements to verifiably reduce and eliminate their nuclear arsenals according to negotiated timetables; (ii) the Russian Federation to pursue and conclude new nuclear arms control and disarmament arrangements with the Russian Federation to prevent a buildup of nuclear forces beyond current levels; and (iii) the People's Republic of China on mutual nuclear risk reduction and arms control measures; (B) leading the effort to have all nuclear-armed countries renounce the option of using nuclear weapons first; (C) implementing effective checks and balances on the sole authority of the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to order the use of United States nuclear weapons; (D) ending the Cold War-era ``hair-trigger alert'' posture, which increases the risk of catastrophic miscalculation in a crisis;

Whereas the UNCLOS builds on four 1958 Law of the Sea conventions to which the United States is a party, namely the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, the Convention on the High Seas, the Convention on the Continental Shelf, and the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas, all done at Geneva April 29, 1958; Whereas the UNCLOS and an associated 1994 agreement relating to implementation of the treaty were transmitted to the Senate on October 6, 1994, and, in the absence of Senate advice and consent to ratification, the United States is not a party to the treaty or the associated 1994 agreement; Whereas, as of January 2025, 170 parties have ratified UNCLOS, including 166 United Nations member states, but not the United States; Whereas the United States, like most other countries, maintains that coastal States under the UNCLOS have the right to regulate economic activities in their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), but do not have the right to regulate foreign military activities in their EEZs; ] Whereas the treaty's provisions relating to navigational rights, including navigational rights in EEZs, reflect the diplomatic position of the United States on the issue dating back to the adoption of the UNCLOS in 1982; Whereas becoming a party to the treaty would codify the United States' current position of recognizing the provisions within the UNCLOS as customary international law; Whereas becoming a party to the treaty would give the United States standing to participate in discussions relating to the treaty and thereby improve the ability of the United States to intervene as a full party to disputes relating to navigational rights and to defend United States interpretations of the treaty's provisions, including those relating to whether coastal states have a right under the UNCLOS to regulate foreign military activities in their EEZs; Whereas becoming a party to the treaty would allow the United States to be a member of the International Seabed Authority and thereby participate directly in setting and voting on the policies organizing and controlling mineral- related activities in the international seabed area as global demand for critical minerals increases; Whereas more than 97 percent of the global internet traffic relies on infrastructure located on the seabed of the world's oceans compared to space-based infrastructure; Whereas lack of full-party membership to UNCLOS limits the access and influence of the United States to critical territorial dispute management, including matters involving pursuit and competition of extended outer continental shelf submissions, facilitated primarily by Article 76, which represents the main tool assisting sovereign authority delimitation agreements; Whereas relying on customary international norms to defend United States interests in those issues is not sufficient, because customary international law is not universally accepted and is subject to change over time based on state practice; Whereas relying on other countries to assert claims on behalf of the United States at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague is woefully insufficient to defend and uphold United States sovereign rights and interests; Whereas the Permanent Court of Arbitration, in the July 12, 2016, ruling on the case In the Matter of the South China Sea Arbitration, stated that ``the Tribunal communicated to the Parties and the U.S."", ""When protesting excessive maritime claims asserted by the People's Republic of China in the South China Sea, the Russian Federation in the Arctic region, and others, the United States would come from a position of increased authority and influence,'' in response to advance policy questions on September 14, 2023, before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate;

(2) to promote, and assist other governments in the promotion of, the fundamental right to freedom of religion; (3) to stand for liberty and with the persecuted; (4) to use and implement appropriate tools in the United States foreign policy apparatus, including diplomatic, political, commercial, charitable, educational, and cultural channels; and (5) to promote respect for religious freedom by all governments and peoples; Whereas, under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has designated the People's Republic of China as a ``country of particular concern for religious freedom'' every year since 1999;

Whereas the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328), enacted by Congress in 2016, gives the President the authority to impose targeted sanctions on individuals responsible for committing human rights violations; Whereas the People's Republic of China is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, done at Paris December 10, 1948, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966, which recognize freedom of religion as a fundamental human right; Whereas Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China explicitly states that citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief; and Whereas the United States must show strong international leadership when it comes to the advancement of religious freedoms, liberties, and protections: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) strongly condemns the Chinese Communist Party's persecution of religious minorities, including Pastor ``Ezra'' Jin Mingri and other leaders and members of Zion Church and other faith communities; (2) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to promote religious freedom and tolerance around the world and to help provide protection and relief to religious minorities facing persecution and violence; (3) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China to release the members of Zion Church, including Pastor Jin, and all other wrongfully detained religious leaders; and (4) demands that the Government of the People's Republic of China-- (A) respect the internationally recognized human right to freedom from religious persecution;

Whereas AI will unlock untold opportunities in nearly every sector in the global economy, from healthcare to manufacturing, defense, energy, and finance; Whereas AI is also a national security imperative, with the potential to reshape military strategies, cybersecurity, and intelligence operations, requiring both the United States Government and the private sector to collaborate in preserving the technological superiority of the United States; Whereas the United States has historically led the world in AI research and development, fostering a dynamic ecosystem of cutting-edge technologies driven by the collaboration between government, academia, and the private sector; Whereas the global competition for AI supremacy is intensifying, with the Government of the People's Republic of China making substantial investments in AI research, development, and deployment with the stated goal of becoming the world leader in AI by 2030 and leveraging state-backed policies to accelerate AI adoption across various domains; Whereas the White House AI Action Plan notes that ``just like we won the space race, it is imperative that the United States win this race'' and ``achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance''; Whereas AI dominance will be decided by relative strength across multiple pillars, including talent, energy, and compute, with the United States maintaining a clear lead in compute while China's investments have yielded advantages in energy and talent; Whereas United States chipmakers, working with manufacturers in Taiwan, produce millions of United States- designed AI chips per year, while Chinese chipmakers are projected to produce no more than 200,000 advanced chips this year, according to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutinick, each of which is far less powerful than AI chips designed in the United States; Whereas United States companies produce 43 to 120 times more computing power than their Chinese equivalent, taking into account both the number and quality of United States- made chips, and United States chips are in effect the only true option for training advanced AI systems such that even leading Chinese firms use United States-produced chips; Whereas China--despite more than a decade of major Chinese indigenization efforts and more than $200,000,000,000 in investments since 2014--has struggled to produce advanced AI chips and therefore has to rely on smuggling or legal exports of advanced chips from the United States; Whereas export controls on advanced chips, chip design software, tools, and manufacturing equipment have denied the Government of the People's Republic of China the opportunity to develop domestic chipmaking capabilities and capture significant market share of global AI infrastructure; Whereas it is essential that the United States remain the world's hub for AI development, training, inference, and innovation; and Whereas preserving the United States lead in AI will require ensuring United States AI companies can access the energy, compute, and talent they require: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) affirms that the preservation of the United States' primacy in artificial intelligence is a national imperative that is critical to maintaining our global leadership, economic prosperity, and national security; (2) commends the White House AI Action Plan, including its recognition that ``advanced AI compute is essential to the AI era, enabling both economic dynamism and novel military capabilities'' and that ``denying our foreign adversaries access to this resource, then, is a matter of both geostrategic competition and national security''; (3) applauds United States Government efforts to deny the Government of the People's Republic of China access to advanced chips and chipmaking equipment, and affirms the importance of continuing these efforts; (4) recognizes that efforts of the Government of the People's Republic China to close the AI gap and leap ahead of the United States in developing frontier AI models, and deploy Chinese AI models for the world to use and build on, present a clear and imminent threat to the United States, and that China's self-acknowledged inability to make and access computing power is the main impediment to its progress; (5) emphasizes that the world's most powerful supercomputers and next generation of AI models must be built in the United States and by United States companies; (6) calls on the United States Government to ensure that United States companies maintain priority access to the cutting-edge AI chips they require to build frontier AI models and are not deprioritized in favor of buyers in China or other arms-embargoed countries; (7) emphasizes the importance of exporting the full United States AI stack--which includes United States AI chips, cloud infrastructure, and models--to allies and partners, while restricting access to the most sophisticated chips and models that United States adversaries may seek to use against the United States, whether by enforcing export controls and countering illegal chip diversion or by strategically limiting legal exports of advanced chips to adversary countries; and (8) asserts the need to prioritize investments in the energy, telecommunications, and physical infrastructure necessary to enable widespread adoption of AI technology.""]",None,

Whereas the claim by the Chinese Communist Party that forces under its command deserve primary credit for the victory of the Allies over the Empire of Japan in World War II is a historical revisionist claim that amounts to ``stolen valor'' at the expense of the Republic of China, the United States' wartime ally, and the Armed Forces of the United States, which carried out the bulk of the fighting in the Pacific Theater; Whereas the brunt of the war effort against the then-Empire of Japan in China was borne by the Republic of China and armed forces under the leadership of Chinese Nationalists (also known as the ``Kuomintang''); Whereas, even before the formal declaration of war between the United States and the Empire of Japan, former American servicemen formed the American Volunteer Group, known as the ``Flying Tigers'', to assist the Republic of China in its war of resistance; Whereas, following the entry of the United States into World War II, Lieutenant General Joseph Stilwell, the Allied commander for forces operating in the China-Burma-India Theater, and General Sun Li-jen, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute, collaborated extensively in such theater; Whereas the Chinese Communist Party and its forces did minimal fighting against the Empire of Japan relative to the Chinese Nationalist and United States forces, allowing the armed forces of the Republic of China to bear the brunt of the mainland fighting and casualties while building up military strength, with the support of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (commonly known as the ``Soviet Union''), for the upcoming civil war the Chinese Communist Party intended to wage against the Government of the Republic of China, with the objective of bringing China under Communist control; Whereas, in a 1939 report to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, Chou En-lai (Zhou Enlai), a member of the Chinese Communist Party, acknowledged that of an estimated 1,000,000 casualties suffered in combat with the Empire of Japan through the summer of 1939, only three percent were Communist forces, conceding the leadership role of the Chinese Nationalist forces of the Republic of China; Whereas the Soviet Union, which signed a non-aggression pact with Japan in April 1941, entered the Pacific Theater on August 9, 1945, six days before the de facto cessation of hostilities by the Empire of Japan, and continued military campaigns beyond August 15 in an effort to occupy as much territory and weaponry in Northeastern China and Manchuria for the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party and obtain as much materiel and industrial equipment as possible for shipment back to the Soviet Union; Whereas, on September 2, 1945, the Government of the Empire of Japan signed the Instrument of Surrender (referred to in this preamble as the ``Instrument'') and affixed seals to it aboard the USS Missouri, bringing the War in the Pacific to an end; Whereas, at the signing of the Instrument, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur signed for the Allied Powers, the Republic of China, as a wartime ally of the United States, was represented by General Hsu Yung-ch'ang, and the United States was represented by Fleet Admiral Chester W."", ""Nimitz; Whereas the Empire of Japan presented the Instrument to the Government of the Republic of China at its capital in Nanking on September 9, 1945, satisfying the requirement that a signed copy of the Instrument be formally conveyed; Whereas, despite the Chinese Communist Party having entered into a United Front coalition with the Chinese Nationalists in 1937, the Chinese Communist Party restarted a civil war soon after the end of World War II, seeking to defeat the Chinese Nationalists and take control of mainland China; Whereas, on November 3, 1946, Japan promulgated a new constitution, effective May 3, 1947, and became a partner for peace in East Asia; Whereas, on September 8, 1951, Japan signed the Security Treaty Between the ] United States of America and Japan, which entered into force on April 28, 1952; Whereas the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States of America and Japan (commonly known as the ``United States-Japan Security Treaty''), done at Washington, January 19, 1960, allows for robust cooperation between Japan and the United States to preserve peace in Asia; Whereas the Japan Self-Defense Forces are able to rapidly deploy a humanitarian disaster relief response; Whereas Japan is a member of ``the Quad'' and other multilateral dialogues that emphasize the need to preserve freedom of navigation and peace in the Indo-Pacific in the face of the aggressive activities by the People's Republic of China threatening those principles; Whereas the Republic of China, often referred to as the ``Republic of China Taiwan'', endures today, and President Lai Ching-te in his public addresses has-- (1) also invoked this name, recalling the pre-1945 history of the Republic of China and the contributions made by Chinese Nationalist soldiers and graduates of the Whampoa Military Academy; and (2) joined with other World War II allies of the Republic of China in commemoration of Victory in Europe; and Whereas the Chinese Communist Party routinely employs propaganda and censorship to construct a distorted narrative about its past and present actions that are at odds with actual history: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) urges the United States Government, via public diplomacy and media outreach, to counter-- (A) the historical revisionism and propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party, particularly with regard to the Allied Victory in World War II; and (B) the ``stolen valor'' narrative of the Chinese Communist Party, which seeks to downplay the role of the Republic of China and elevate that of the forces of the Chinese Communist Party; (2) calls upon the Secretary of State to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations and other international organizations to counter efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to distort history, including efforts to distort and disregard the actual text of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI); (3) exhorts the Secretary of Education and State and local school boards to ensure that history regarding allies of the United States during World War II is taught with historical accuracy and guards against propaganda narratives perpetuated by the Chinese Communist Party; (4) recognizes the wartime accomplishments of the Republic of China, the United States, and their allies; (5) commends the heroism and altruism of the American Volunteer Group; (6) recognizes the critical role played by Japan, along with the United States and Taiwan, and other likeminded allies and partners of the United States to preserve peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region; and (7) supports efforts by Taiwan, consistent with the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement (TAIPEI) Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-135), in strengthening its official diplomatic relationships and other partnerships with countries around the world, as well as its participation in international organizations.""]",None,
